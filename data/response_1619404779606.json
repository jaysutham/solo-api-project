    "description": "Aranea Highwind (アラネア・ハイウィンド Aranea Haiwindo) is a boss and a guest party member in Final Fantasy XV. She is a mercenary who serves as the the commodore of the Niflheim Empire's Third Army Corps 86th Airborne Unit. Her skill in aerial combat and wielding of a lance makes her akin to a Dragoon, a traditional job class from the Final Fantasy series. Aranea is a hard-edged and free-spirited mercenary whose loyalty and motivations are ambiguous. While she ranks highly within the empire, she is unafraid to speak about her distrust of other high ranking officials. Despite her status, she speaks to others in a casual manner, and is rather mischievous. She chooses her own path, and encourages others to do the same. Aranea is fought as a boss, and appears as a guest party member. She is agile, and uses airborne jump attacks with her lance. When in the party, she can perform link-strikes with the player character and be given various Technique commands, including Highwind, her signature ability. Aranea will get her own DLC episode in 2019. Its working title is \"The Beginning of the End\".",
